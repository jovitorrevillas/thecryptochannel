<em>Senior VP for Business Development to leave solutions provider to establish new blockchain and gambling venture.</em>
<div><strong>London, UK ‚Äì 19 March 2018.</strong>¬†Tom Light, Senior Vice-President of Business Development at SBTech, is to leave the group to establish a new business venture that will unite blockchain and gambling and leverage the power of the crypto-currency in a gaming and betting environment.</div>
Tom Light joined SBTech in 2014 to lead its business development and commercial efforts and initiated the massive growth curve the group has experienced since.

He has been responsible for signing many of SBTech‚Äôs defining partnerships and will continue to retain the full support of the company in future projects.

Commenting on his next move, Tom Light said: ‚ÄúI have really enjoyed working at SBTech and seeing the group grow to become the leading sports betting and gaming solutions provider to the sector. The new project I will be heading is particularly exciting as it combines two great passions of mine: blockchain and gambling. It will leverage the power of crypto-currencies within an igaming setting and produce a truly disruptive offer for the sector.‚Äù

Richard Carter, CEO of SBTech, added: ‚ÄúSBTech is particularly grateful to Tom for his incredible work over the past four years, which has enabled us to experience massive growth and has put SBTech in prime position to capitalise on future opportunities in the online and land-based gaming and betting sector worldwide. He retains the full support of SBTech and we look forward to his new project, which we believe will be as successful as the past four years he has had with SBTech.‚Äù

Tom Light recently discussed the possibilities of blockchain within gambling at the iGaming Asia Congress in Macau in the company of Mikhail Bogdanov, CEO of Firelotto and Tony Tong, Crypto Angel Investor at DRC ‚Äì Drchain.io.
