<p dir="ltr"><strong>Limassol, Cyprus (March 8, 2018)</strong>¬†‚Äî Circle.One is a blockchain-based marketplace for data, analytics and research. Become a Circle decision maker and reserve your CLC tokens now. ICO starting in Q2/18.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The scientific and research market is crying for disruption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Important research remains unpublished while the quality of mainstream scientific journals is rapidly sinking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Researchers lack relevant data, while the number of possible data sources is exploding at the same time, thanks to IoT sensors and the increased digitalization. Most of this data never gets used and is locked up in company data centers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Circle.One will offer world class data, analytics and research that are:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
 	<li>easy to find</li>
 	<li>rated by users just like you</li>
 	<li>instantly available</li>
 	<li>with a fee-less payment system</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">CIRCLE.ONE¬†‚Äì make informed decisions! Make more money!</p>
<p dir="ltr">A working, blockchain-powered proof of concept was already developed by the experienced in-house developers. CIRCLE.ONE is going full blast to bring this project to fruition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‚ÄòBig Industry players like financial services, medical research, pharmaceutical, manufacturing or consumer statistics are based on data and research. These industries have great purchasing power and are able to spend tens of thousands of dollars on information, when it is essential for their business and decision-making process. Circle.One delivers this kind of information and provides the data and research needed. The ease of use and scope offered make us the Amazon of data, analytics and research,‚Äô said Walter Komarek, CEO and co-founder of Circle.One.</p>

<h2>Join our ICO</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Starting on 8th of March, Circle.One will accept selected investors for its private pre-sale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Circle.One‚Äôs token is called CLC. CLC is a QRC20 token on the Qtum blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our public ICO will start in Q2/18.</p>

<h2>Main ICO details</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There will never be more than 500.000.000 CLCs .</p>
<p dir="ltr">Limited bonuses are negotiated on a one to one basis during the private pre-sale phase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CLC token will be used to pay for all aspects of CIRCLE.ONE‚Äôs ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token‚Äôs value will appreciate substantially, as demand for the network grows. And more and better quality is on offer.</p>
