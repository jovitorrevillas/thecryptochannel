<h2 class="name">1. What is the sharing economy?</h2>
&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr"><em>Put simply, this is where individuals share items or services, usually on the internet.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Even if you haven‚Äôt heard the term, you‚Äôll know about the phenomenon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Through countless apps and websites, it‚Äôs possible to rent things by the day or the week ‚Äì even by the hour. Occasionally it‚Äôs free, but usually there‚Äôs a fee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For those doing the borrowing, it can bring considerable savings when compared to buying a brand-new item that might only need to be used once.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, for individuals who are willing to share their stuff, the concept can help them make a decent side income ‚Äì boosting their usual earnings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As well as traditional rental firms, several tech-savvy companies have launched platforms to facilitate sharing between individuals.</p>
Given the sharing economy is still in its infancy, most of us have little awareness about the plethora of companies already in this industry. The accommodation app Airbnb and ride-hailing service Uber are two of the biggest and best-known players, and both are now mainstays in cities worldwide.
