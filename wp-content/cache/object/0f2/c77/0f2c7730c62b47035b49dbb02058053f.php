<p dir="ltr">An IT manager from the state of Floridaâ€™s Department of Citrus (FDoC) has been arrested this week for using the FDoCâ€™s computer system toÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-mining" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mine</a>Â for cryptocurrencies, according to aÂ <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/Department-of-Citrus-employee-arrested-when-caught-mining-for-cryptocurrency-agents-say_166345974" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">Tampa Bay Times</a>Â article published March 13.</p>
According to theÂ <a href="http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/News/2018/March/Department-of-Citrus-manager-arrested-on-grand-the" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">Florida Department of Law Enforcement</a>Â (FDLE), FDoC employee Matthew McDermott was using computers in the Department of Citrus to mine for cryptocurrencies includingÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>Â (BTC) andÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litecoin</a>Â (LTC).

Crypto mining requires a large amount of electricity, and the utility bills for the Department of Citrus had jumped more than 40 percent from October 2017 to January 2018, around $825.

McDermott has been charged with grand theft and official misconduct and is currently at Polk County jail. The FDLE also noted that McDermott had purchased 24 graphic processing units for over $22,000 using a â€œstate purchasing cardâ€ from July to December.
