<p dir="ltr">Jack Dorsey, the CEO of bothÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>Â and payment serviceÂ <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">Square</a>, has said that he seesÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>(BTC) as the worldâ€™s â€“ and Internetâ€™s â€“ single future currency,Â <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bitcoin-will-become-the-worlds-single-currency-tech-chief-says-66slm0p6b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">The Times</a>Â reports today, March 21.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dorsey believes that Bitcoinâ€™s leading emergence will take â€œprobably over ten years, but it could go fasterâ€:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œThe world ultimately will have a single currency, the Internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of February 2018, Dorsey hadÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/jack-dorsey-square-will-go-further-with-bitcoin-than-buysell-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously said</a>Â that Square will focus on developing more options for interacting with Bitcoin via their Cash App, calling it a â€œtransformation technology for our industry.â€</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dorsey did note to The Times that he does not believe that at the moment BTC has the capabilities to become an effective currency, namely as a medium of exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s slow and itâ€™s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable.â€</p>

Last week, Lightning Labs, aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Network</a>Â (LN) developer,Â <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-bitcoin-mainnet-lightning-network-product-launches-as-developers-net-25-mln" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released the first Bitcoin ready LN implementation</a>, making free and instantaneous BTC transactions closer to reality. Dorsey had participated in their $2.5 mln seed finance round, as didÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litecoin</a>â€™s (LTC) creatorÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/charlie-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Lee</a>.
