<p dir="ltr">With 1 billion tokens up for grabs, players and investors can snap up 75% of the company, with Cryptonia keeping 20% back to fund promotions and tournaments, with only 5% of the total paid out to promoters and advisers to get the room up and running.</p>

<div>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, one of the biggest selling points of crypto-poker rooms over their rivals is the security aspect ‚Äì and the blockchain technology which Cryptonia‚Äôs platform is based on ensures fair play and also helps to avoid delays in payment processing, offering absolute transparency and ease of play.</p>

<h2>So, what can players expect from Cyptonia?</h2>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">The first part of the plan is to get the tournament schedule up-and-running, with attractive guarantees designed to pull in new players and boost the pool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This in turn will see the price of Cryptonia rise so, as with most ICO‚Äôs, it‚Äôs the early birds who make the most out of it.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Rakeback scheme</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptonia‚Äôs plan to return 35% of the rake every month will see them add it to jackpots, bounties and tournament guarantees, the combination designed to motivate people to play more and also to add liquidity to the poker rooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the Cryptonia community grows, so too will the number and variants of games on offer, with a 24/7 schedule to ‚Äòentertain gamers from different parts of the world‚Äô and of all different levels.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Huge Market Value</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptonia are looking to cut themselves a chunk of an online gambling market which is expected to hit $59.79 billion dollars by the year 2020 and their eponymous currency ‚ÄòCryptonias‚Äô will help those who invest and/or win at the tables ‚Äì the value expected to grow as the room gets bigger and players start winning and spending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With their Ethereum-based currency listed on exchanges, users getting value additions on the currency they hold, players can also add or withdraw funds easily and quickly wherever they live. Cryptonia Poker explain that ‚Äòthe Ethereum-based contracts comply with ERC20‚Äô so transactions can be carried out ‚Äòwith ease of mind‚Äô.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Anti-bot, pro-amateur</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptonia Poker are well aware of the modern-day trend for sites to be infested with poker-playing robots ‚Äì or bots as they are known ‚Äì and are ahead of the game when it comes to rooting them out, ‚Äòmeasures being taken and programs being integrated in the platform to ensure that only recreational players will benefit‚Äô according to the developers behind the new crypto-poker room.</p>
