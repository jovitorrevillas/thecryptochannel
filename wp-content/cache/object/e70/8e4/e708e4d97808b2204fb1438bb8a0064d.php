<p dir="ltr"><em>This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The inner workings of Tether have been under constant scrutiny and theyâ€™re in the spotlight again after issuingÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/controversial-tether-issues-300-mln-in-new-tokens-critics-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 mln new Tether tokens last week</a>. To understand why Tether has been theÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-strange-story-of-tether-the-digital-money-that-claims-it-isnt-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of controversy</a>Â for theÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitfinex-tether-get-subpoenas-from-us-regulators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past six months</a>, one should rememberÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/tether-case-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how this cryptocurrency works</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Tether, USDT tokens are â€œbackedâ€™ by US Dollars in a 1:1 ratio. In the last six months, Tether have beenÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-really-isnt-a-scam-company-promises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">constantly accused of not having sufficient fiat reserves</a>Â to back the tokens that they periodically issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thatâ€™s why some industry critics paid special attention to the changes in a price of Bitcoin that have come after the issuance of new Tether tokens. Given that Tether is equal to one dollar, users have been buying various cryptocurrencies with Tether tokens. If these tokens are not backed by an equal amount of dollars, cryptocurrencies prices, in particular, may have been irregularly inflated.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Point proven again?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Casting aside speculation on the reserves backing Tether tokens, the issuance of 300 mln new USDT last week once again coincided with aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/controversial-tether-issues-300-mln-in-new-tokens-critics-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six percent rebound in the price of Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This prompted fresh reactions from critics - with outspoken anonymous blogger Bitfinexâ€™ed leading the charge withÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/controversial-tether-issues-300-mln-in-new-tokens-critics-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another heated tweet</a>. Tether and sister company cryptocurrency exchange BitfinexÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/worlds-largest-bitcoin-exchange-bitfinex-threatens-critics-with-legal-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened legal action</a>Â against critics in December.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In January 2018, Pantera Capital chief investment officer Joey Krug expressed concerns that these rallies had led to Bitcoin rise to anÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hits-20000-per-coin-capping-year-of-enormous-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-time high in $20,000</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen. It could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tether refute claims, but still unaudited</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Prompted by aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitfinex-tether-get-subpoenas-from-us-regulators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoena from US regulators in December</a>Â 2017, Tether reacquired the services of Friedmann LLP to conduct an audit on itâ€™s US dollar reserves. However, a month later, news broke that the Tether had parted ways with their auditors, meaning no audit results were ever disclosed.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">No official audit ever done</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Before the subpoena from Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) - Tetherâ€™s employed Friedman LLP to conduct an audit inÂ <a href="https://tether.to/announcement-transparency-update/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">what they described on an â€˜expedited basis.â€™</a>Â Tether then posted the memorandum as an attachment to that announcementÂ <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">on its website</a>. They also stated that it was not an official audit or attestation engagement, but hoped to appease concerned critics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œWe hope that the community considers theÂ <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">attached memorandum</a>Â for what it is: a good faith effort on our behalf to provide an interim analysis of our cash position and our issued and outstanding tokens, as part of ongoing efforts to further professionalize the transparency mechanisms of Tether Limited.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">According to the document, as of Sept. 15, 2017, Tether had $442.9 mln reserve in its bank accounts while a little over 442 mln Tether tokens issued and outstanding. At that point, Tether was in the clear in terms of their reserves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While it still isnâ€™t completely clear what led to the breakdown between Tether and Friedman LLP, BloombergÂ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">reported</a>Â that Tether wasnâ€™t happy with the time frame given for the latest audit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œGiven the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable timeframe.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Cointelegraph reached out to American accountant and auditor Abhishek Shah, who had reviewed the memorandum released by Friedman LLP. Shah says the document showed that Tether did have the necessary US Dollars reserves at that time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Shah founds it disconcerting that Tether had terminated the audit due to the timeframe given:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œThe reason given by Tether was certainly not clear and precise, neither acceptable. An audit is to be allowed as much time as required, albeit the audit needs to be concluded before the due date. It is not a reasonable ground and I've personally not heard of such a reason in my auditing career.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 dir="ltr">Community must demand an audit</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shah goes on to concede that Bitfinex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, could well have the necessary reserves to back up Tether. Nevertheless, Shah believes pressure from the community is the only thing that will lead to a transparent audit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œThe Crypto community should come together and demand a complete independent audit of Tether. Research suggests that Bitfinex makes enough trading and lending fees to have enough cash reserves. Bitmex research was able to track the banks which supposedly have the cash reserves. There is no doubt that they could have the required reserves, but an audit is required and refusal to do so would only create an unstable environment.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Shah calls any talk of an audit of a cryptocurrency exchange being too difficult due to the new technology â€˜nonsensical.â€™</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œThis is a completely redundant statement. We've audited companies which handle far more complicated operations, which deal in Derivatives and Futures markets which have a lot bigger market cap, using algorithmic trading. We have, and every reputed audit firm has a separate IT department which creates a blueprint of a flowchart to aid the auditors.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 dir="ltr">Nothing to fear?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As Shah reminds us, there are entities that believe Tether and Bitfinex are acting in good faith.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmex-tether-possibly-has-enough-cash-reserves-could-still-be-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In February 2018,</a>Â a report from Bitcoin derivatives exchangeÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmex-tether-possibly-has-enough-cash-reserves-could-still-be-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitmex suggested that Tether</a>Â does indeed have sufficient reserves to back all outstanding USDT tokens in circulation. Bitmex added that Tether may have US dollar reserves in a Puerto Rican bank account, which is believedÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-puerto-rico-a-crypto-tax-paradise-expert-take" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be a cryptocurrency tax haven</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Bitmex opinion, a hard fork carried out by Tether in the wake of aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-tether-allegedly-hacked-for-30-mln" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$31mln hack</a>Â showed that the developers had complete control of its ledger, tokens and funds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">â€œ(This) demonstrated that Tether is effectively in complete control of the ledger, as they can force a hard fork at will and reverse any transaction- although there may not have been any doubt about Tetherâ€™s control beforehand.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">In an announcement on its website on Dec. 19 2017, Tether stated that its wallet services were slowly being restored after the hack. Furthermore, TetherÂ <a href="https://tether.to/wallet-service-and-platform-update/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">announced</a>Â developing a new platform. There are no further updates on this new platform on the website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users were directed to use alternative exchanges to buy or sell new Tether tokens for US Dollars or other cryptocurrencies. USDT have continued to be issued, as seen on theÂ <a href="https://omniexplorer.info/asset/31" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">Tether Omi Explorer</a>.</p>
