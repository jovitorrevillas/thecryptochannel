Speaking via webcam in an interview with Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh at the Blockstack Berlin 2018 conference, Snowden agreed Bitcoinâ€™s ledger was â€œdevastatingly public.â€

â€œThe much larger structural flaw, the long-lasting flaw, is its public ledger,â€ he said of Bitcoin, adding that he nonetheless â€œmayâ€ have used it to buy server infrastructure in 2013.

Bitcoinâ€™s future remains a hot topic of debate this year as technical improvements to its network increasingly allow it to be used as an instant, near-free currency once again.

This week, Twitter CEO Jack DorseyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-says-bitcoin-will-become-worlds-single-currency-within-a-decad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a>Â mainstream media that he foresees a â€œsingle currencyâ€ for the internet coming within ten years. â€œI personally believe that it will be Bitcoin,â€ he added.

For Snowden, however, a true alternative to fiat currencies that balances mass appeal with lack of government control has yet to surface:
<blockquote>â€œItâ€™s a question of how do we design competing systems that are simply so attractive that they will not be ignored by the global consumer base but also the governments themselves who are seeking to compete against them will not simply be able to outlaw them and have that be meaningful.â€</blockquote>
Not just Bitcoin came in for questioning, but altcoins as well; Snowden confirmed he had usedÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/monero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero</a>, while reiterating his support forÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/zcash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZCash</a>Â as the â€œmost interestingâ€ altcoin currently on the market due to its â€œuniqueâ€ privacy setup.

Van Valkenburgh himself was fresh from aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/at-dc-hearing-coinbase-calls-out-federal-regulators-for-harming-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Congressional hearing</a>Â on the future of cryptocurrency regulation that took place last week on March 14.

As one of the four key witnesses at the hearing, defence of Bitcoinâ€™s core values was a conspicuous priority in the face of opposition from some political sources.

â€œThe fundamental innovation of Bitcoin is digital scarcity,â€ he told lawmakers in hisÂ <a href="https://coincenter.org/link/coin-center-s-peter-van-valkenburgh-to-testify-in-upcoming-congressional-hearing-on-cryptocurrencies-and-icos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">testimony</a>.
<blockquote>â€œThat digital scarcity can then be employed by innovative people for a variety of innovative purposes. A token that is scarce and transferable from person to person can be used just like money, just as any good throughout history from gold to seashells.â€</blockquote>
