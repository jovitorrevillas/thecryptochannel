<p dir="ltr">The Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Muradov, told a group of journalists on Wednesday:</p>
<p dir="ltr">‚ÄúWe are discussing ways to avoid sanctions. One of these methods is the creation of a cryptocurrency investment fund in Crimea where we will accumulate cryptocurrency resources, transfer them to normal money, and then use them for the realization of any kind of investment projects on Crimean soil.‚Äù</p>

Muradov added that throughout the course of the conference, they hope to secure ten investment agreements between various foreign and Crimean companies.</p>

In order to enforce the ban, communications authority Roskomnadzor blocked nearly 20 mln IP addresses. Despite all efforts by the government to disable the app within¬†<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/russia">Russia</a>, most users report that it is functioning without applying additional means to circumvent the block, like proxy or VPN services.</p>
