<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/brazil">Brazil</a>â€™s largest investment company XP Investimentos is allegedly seeking to launch an over-the-counter (OTC)Â <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/exchanges">Bitcoin exchange</a>, local news outlet Portal do BitcoinÂ <a href="https://portaldobitcoin.com/xp-investimentos-criar-corretora-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">revealed</a>Â Tuesday, April 17.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Appearing to confirm documents filed with Brazilâ€™s Department of Federal Revenue, anonymous sources told Portal do Bitcoin that the company was specifically eyeing the OTC market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reported move is the first for XP, which first registered an outfit called XP COIN INTERMEDIACAO in August 2017, the publication reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Later that year, following a 5 mln reals (about $1.5 mln) capital injection, the company rebranded to become XDEX, according to data from the SÃ£o Paulo State Board of Trade. Since then the company has received another 20 mln reals ($5.9 mln).</p>
<p dir="ltr">WhileÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-central-bank-ramps-up-blockchain-rd-efforts">showing interest</a>Â inÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">Blockchain technology</a>Â like many governments worldwide, Brazil has generally remained suspicious of interaction with Bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In October 2017, Ilan Goldfajn, president of the countryâ€™s central bank,Â <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-central-bank-president-says-bitcoin-is-pyramid-scheme">likened</a>Â Bitcoin to a â€œpyramid schemeâ€ and described it as â€œa financial asset with no ballast.â€</p>
<p dir="ltr">XP Investimentosâ€™ alleged entry into crypto is thus a conspicuous rebuttal of establishment suspicion, the giant boastingÂ <a href="https://institucional.xpi.com.br/clientesinstitucionais/en/xp-management-of-resources.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">3.2 bln reals</a>Â (almost $1 bln) in assets under management.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AnÂ <a href="http://www.xdex.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">official website</a>Â for XDEX is already reserved but currently contains no information.</p>
