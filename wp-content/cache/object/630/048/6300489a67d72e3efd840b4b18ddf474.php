<p dir="ltr">Renwick Haddow, a British citizen and allegedÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>Â fraudster has been extradited from Morocco to the U.S. and appeared in a Manhattan District Court on Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)Â <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/british-citizen-extradited-morocco-defrauding-investors-more-36-million" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">announced</a>Â April 13.</p>
The DoJ complaint alleges Haddow, 49, â€œmisappropriated investor fundsâ€ and "made false and misleading representationsâ€ to investors in Bitcoin Store, Bar Works, and related schemes, from Nov. 2014 through June 2017. He has been charged with two counts of wire fraud - for Bitcoin Store and Bar Works respectively - with each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Haddow was taken into police custody in Tangiers last July after Interpol issued aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-store-operator-lost-investors-40-mln-reports">warrant for his arrest</a>. The warrant followed the SECâ€™s applications for final default judgements against three of Haddowâ€™s schemes, ordering him to pay penalties in excess of $83 mln for securities fraud.

Bitcoin Store was purportedly a crypto exchange, although the SECÂ <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2017/comp-pr2017-123.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">alleged</a>Â investor funds were diverted and the exchange never became â€œprofitableâ€. Bar Works, meanwhile, illicitly leased co-working space services to investors around the world. The SEC alleged Haddow defrauded investors out of over $37 mln in total. In both schemes, Haddow is said to have concealed his involvement under false identities.

Earlier this month, the SECÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-busts-fraudulent-ico-endorsed-by-floyd-mayweather-founders-defrauded-32-mln">charged</a>Â a fraudulent celebrity-endorsed ICO with illicitly raising $32 mln in unregistered investments. In mid-March, the SECâ€™ Enforcement Division co-director confirmed the agency is currently conductingÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-sec-official-confirms-dozens-of-cryptocurrency-probes">â€œdozensâ€ of cryptocurrency-related investigations</a>across the U.S.
