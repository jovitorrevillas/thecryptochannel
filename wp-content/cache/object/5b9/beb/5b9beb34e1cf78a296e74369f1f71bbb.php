Vectra analyzed five industries where crypto mining â€“ which the blog post defines as â€œan opportunistic attack behavior that uses botnets to create a large pool of computing powerâ€, incorrectly combining crypto mining and cryptojacking into one use case â€“ has occurred from August 2017 to January 2018, finding that â€œhigher educationâ€ sees more mining than the other four industries combined.

<p dir="ltr">Universities are not able to monitor their networks as strictly as corporations, â€œat best advis[ing] students on how to protect themselves and the university by installing operating system patches and creating awareness of phishing emails, suspicious websites and web ads,â€ leaving college campuses more open to cryptojacking schemes. The blog post notes that given the â€œfree source of powerâ€ provided by universities to their students (meaning free of charge to students, not free of charge in essence), â€œ[l]arge student-populations are ideal pastures for cryptojackers.â€</p>
Students, rather than malicious cryptojackers, taking advantage of this â€œfree powerâ€ are â€œsimply being opportunistic as the value of cryptocurrencies surged over the past year,â€ Vectraâ€™s blog post writes.

Joey Dilliha, a student at Western Kentucky University, told financial news siteÂ <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/college-students-are-secretly-mining-bitcoin-in-their-dorms-on-room-check-days-i-have-to-put-a-blanket-over-it-2018-03-29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">MarketWatch</a>Â that he mines crypto with aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitmain</a>Â <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/antminer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antminer</a>Â in his room with his schoolâ€™s â€œfree electricityâ€:
<blockquote>â€œI believe more people should be doing it. Itâ€™s a super fun, and cool cheap way to be introduced to the market of mining.â€</blockquote>
Dilliha adds that because the mining rig is actually a banned item in his dorm â€“ due to it being a fire hazard â€“ he has to â€œturn it off and put a blanket over itâ€ during â€œdorm room check days,â€ adding that his â€œRA loves to come in and talk about it with me.â€
<p dir="ltr">Â In January of this year, Stanford University had posted aÂ <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/news/cryptocurrency-mining" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">warning</a>Â against crypto mining on campus, as school resources â€œmust not be used for personal financial gain,â€ as well as citing the schoolâ€™s chief information security officer:</p>

<blockquote>â€œCryptocurrency mining is most lucrative when computing costs are minimized, which unfortunately has led to compromised systems, misused university computing equipment, and personally owned mining devices using campus power.â€</blockquote>
Vectra also notes the problems with cryptocurrency mining and crypto jacking as â€œcreat[ing noise that can may [sic] hide serious security issues; [...] impact[ing] the reputation of an organizationâ€™s IP address [...] ; [allowing] cybercriminals [to] buy access to compromised computers to launch targeted attacks against universities.â€

Vectraâ€™s blog post, which has already several times confused crypto mining and cryptojacking, then goes into detail about the mechanics of cryptojacking, mentioning Coinhive and theÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptonight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoNight</a>Â algorithm-basedÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/monero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero</a>Â as common ways for cryptojacking to take place.

CointelegraphÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-ethics-of-cryptojacking-rampant-malware-or-ad-free-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently reported</a>Â on the ethics of cryptojacking, citing both cases where permission was asked before taking over a computerâ€™s processing power to mine (likeÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/news-site-salon-gives-users-choice-to-see-ads-or-mine-crypto-to-support-company">Salon.com</a>) as well as malicious or unknown use cases (likeÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/showtime-latest-secret-crypto-pirate-miner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Showtime</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/telecom-egypt-covertly-redirecting-internet-users-to-crypto-mining-sites-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telecom Egypt</a>).
