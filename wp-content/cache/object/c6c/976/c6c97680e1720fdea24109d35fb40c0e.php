<p dir="ltr">The government ofÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/Belgium">Belgium</a>Â is making a contribution of â‚¬2 mln to promote a Blockchain project by the World Food Programme (WFP), the WFPÂ <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/belgium-throws-support-behind-wfps-life-changing-innovations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">announced</a>Â April 19.</p>
The contribution will reportedly allow theÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/United-Nations">United Nations</a>Â (UN) to useÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/Blockchain">Blockchain</a>Â technology to fight against hunger in impoverished areas. The â€œBuilding Blocksâ€ project is piloted with other agencies in the UN and has been implemented to make WFP cash transfers to refugees more efficient and transparent. Over 100,000 Syrian refugees in camps in Jordan have benefited from the project, using donations provided by donors to get food and other crucial resources.

The project was presented at the Leveraging Innovation for Humanitarian Action in New York. Commenting on Belgiumâ€™s contribution to the initiative, the countryâ€™s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Development Cooperation, Alexander De Croo, said:
<blockquote>â€œInnovation saves lives. This year, more than 128 mln people across the world will need humanitarian assistance and protection. This is triple the number of three years ago. Only by finding better ways to deliver aid more efficiently will we close the gap between requirements and aid delivery on the ground. Belgium lauds the efforts of WFP to come up with innovative solutions to save more lives and help more people in need.â€</blockquote>
In May last year, the UNÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-blockchain-will-help-un-go-cashless-distribute-food-to-hungry-in-jordan">announced its plans</a>Â to useÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/Ethereum">Ethereum</a>Â Blockchain technology to ensure refugees in Jordan have access to food rations by distributing coupons which would be used in place of the local currency. The technology had already been tested by the WFP inÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/Pakistan">Pakistan</a>Â with more than 10,000 people having benefited.
