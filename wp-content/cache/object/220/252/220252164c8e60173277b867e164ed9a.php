<p dir="ltr">Springâ€™s chorus of bullish predictions for Bitcoin appears to be having some corroboration from recent markets, as BloombergÂ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-20/bitcoin-positioned-for-2018-s-first-back-to-back-week-of-gains" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">reports</a>Â on Bitcoinâ€™s 4 percent gain today, April 20, putting the coin on track for its first back-to-back week of gains this year.</p>
Bloomberg notes the recent upswing has brought BTCâ€™s gains over the two-week period to almost 29 percent, with an upward trend for other major altcoins as well: Ripple up as much as 19 percent, Ethereum up 7.5 percent and Litecoin, 4 percent.

As an indication of market mood, buy/sell signals for Bitcoin are now showing 90 percent of traders buying Bitcoin, and only ten percent selling,Â <a href="https://www.turtlebc.com/tools/buy_percentage?period=2years" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">for the first time since</a>Â March 2017.

To quote Bloomberg, this mini-recovery somewhat â€œeases the painâ€ of BTCâ€™sÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-sees-around-50-percent-losses-across-the-board-at-end-of-first-quarter-2018">almost 50 percent loss</a>Â in the first quarter of 2018, that followed hard upon late 2017â€™sÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hits-20000-per-coin-capping-year-of-enormous-growth">$20, 000 high water mark</a>.

Now that U.S. tax day (April 17) is over, some are seeing the marketsâ€™ mini rally as aÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-see-more-gains-in-the-wake-of-americas-tax-day">vindication</a>Â of their view that recent momentum to sell off crypto before federal income tax returns were due wasÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wall-street-bitcoin-bull-tom-lee-predicts-massive-outflow-of-crypto-before-tax-day">causing</a>Â much of 2018â€™s price misery.

April has also seen several traditionalÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldman-sachs-exec-leaves-to-join-mike-novogratzs-crypto-merchant-bank-report-says">Wall Street players</a>Â <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedge-fund-och-ziff-exec-leaves-wall-street-to-become-coinbase-cfo">edge into the crypto space</a>, suggesting that anticipation of moreÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-goldman-sachs-vp-joins-crypto-wallet-blockchain-to-attract-institutional-clients">institutional money</a>Â and talent isÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-holds-gains-on-news-of-more-wall-street-talent-and-money-moving-in">positively affecting</a>Â recent markets, and thatÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/2018-mature-crypto-market-will-draw-more-investment-see-less-volatility-analyst-says">significant institutional investment capital</a>Â could flow into the crypto market as it matures.

<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedge-fund-pantera-ceo-says-btc-highly-likely-to-go-past-20k-high-within-a-year">Yesterday</a>Â Dan Morehead, CEO of Blockchain-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital, remarked that even the SEC busting high-profile ICO scams such as as thatÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-busts-fraudulent-ico-endorsed-by-floyd-mayweather-founders-defrauded-32-mln">backed by Floyd Mayweather</a>resulted in markets going up, not down, suggesting that â€œweâ€™ve seen the brunt of the marketâ€™s negative reactionâ€ to regulation.

Bloombergâ€™s insights echo those of moreÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-lee-says-btc-will-hit-25000-in-2018-advises-aggressive-buying-at-market-low">predictably bullish</a>Â Bitcoin analysts such as Tom Lee, who most recentlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wall-street-strategist-tom-lee-still-confident-bitcoin-price-will-reach-25k-in-2018">forecast</a>Â that Bitcoin is likely to hit $25,000 by the yearâ€™s end, and venture capitalist and Bitcoin bull Tim Draperâ€™sÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/im-thinking-250000-by-2022-tim-draper-reveals-new-bitcoin-price-target">who said</a>Â last week: â€œIâ€™m thinking $250,000 by 2022.â€

Cointelegraph recently published an analysis ofÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-headed-for-100000-or-100-ceos-big-investors-and-harvard-economist-predictions">Bitcoin price predictions</a>Â â€” running the gamut from $100 to $100,000 â€” from major investors and economists.
