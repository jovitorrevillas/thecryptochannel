<div class="text">
<p dir="ltr">Every single fiat currency in the world is created, released and controlled by a single entity â€“ in most cases a central bank. By law, ordinary citizens are only allowed to buy, sell or keep the currency. If someone tries to create any amount of money, they will inevitably find themselves behind bars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Bitcoin was introduced, it created a completely new and unique paradigm. The worldâ€™s first digital, decentralized currency that isnâ€™t controlled by anyone at all. Moreover, the very concept of Bitcoin implies that anyone with enough computing power can create coins by simply being an active part of the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As itâ€™s becoming more and more mainstream, law enforcement agencies, tax authorities and legal regulators all over the world are trying to wrap their heads around the concept of cryptocurrency and where exactly does it fit in existing regulations and legal frameworks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legality of Bitcoin depends on who you are, where you are in the world, and what youâ€™re doing with it. Hereâ€™s our guide on legal issues concerning Bitcoin, where we mostly focus on the US but cover other major countries as well.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Concerns about cryptocurrencies<a id="concerns-about-cryptocurrencies" name="concerns-about-cryptocurrencies"></a></h2>
<p dir="ltr">In many jurisdictions, the authorities are still struggling to understand Bitcoin, let alone define it in legal terms. Many concerns have been raised over its decentralized nature. It seems only natural for governing authorities to be worried about a financial community that canâ€™t be fully controlled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This also extends to exchanges and protection of peopleâ€™s funds. While US-based exchanges have to be regulated, there are plenty of offshore platforms that donâ€™t. Indeed, the cryptocurrency history has been filled with instances of exchanges suddenly shutting down and running away with peopleâ€™s funds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most famous of such cases is the closure of the notorious exchange Mt.Gox. At the beginning of 2014, formerly the most prominent Bitcoin exchange in existence filed for bankruptcy due to technological problems and the apparent theft or loss of 744,000 of its users Bitcoins. That number made up about six percent of 12.4 mln Bitcoins in circulation at the time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoinâ€™s ability to be used semi-anonymously is another cause for concern. Even though every single transaction is recorded in the Blockchain, it is very easy for users to stay almost completely anonymous, as those records only contain the public keys and the amount of funds transferred.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of these concerns were voiced after a dark web market Silk Road gained mainstream-media attention, as Bitcoins were the only form of payment accepted there. The market was since shut down by the FBI, but the authorities are still worried about Bitcoinâ€™s appeal among the traders of illegal goods and services. Moreover, it is feared that Bitcoinâ€™s semi-anonymity and decentralized nature can be exploited in money laundering and tax evasion schemes.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Your opportunities depend on the role<a id="your-opportunities-depend-on-the-role" name="your-opportunities-depend-on-the-role"></a></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">Buying goods<a id="buying-goods" name="buying-goods"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img title="Buying goods with Bitcoins is completely legal." src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/65223bbe838b9c8a46cd897da378eefb.jpg" alt="Buying goods with Bitcoins is completely legal." /></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2013, Bitcoin wasÂ <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/testimony/statement-jennifer-shasky-calvery-director-financial-crimes-enforcement-network" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">classified</a>Â as a convertible decentralized virtual currency by the US Treasury Departmentâ€™s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). They have also issued aÂ <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guidance</a>, in which they stated that those who obtain units of virtual currency and use it to purchase goods are not considered money transmitters and are operating within the law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, buying well-natured goods and services with Bitcoins is completely legal. The cryptocurrency is accepted as a form of payment on several major and minor online marketplaces and service providers, includingÂ <a href="https://www.overstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Overstock</a>,Â <a href="https://shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Shopify</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://www.okcupid.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OKCupid</a>. Moreover, there are shops and restaurants all over the US where you can pay with Bitcoins.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Investing<a id="investing" name="investing"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img title="Investing in Bitcoin is within the legal territory." src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/86a51b369daf1741198fe320e9f60763.jpg" alt="Investing in Bitcoin is within the legal territory." /></p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the same guidance, investing in Bitcoin is also within the legal territory. Â Many regulated US-based exchanges have to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies. Â Because of that, those who wish to trade and invest in Bitcoin have to verify their ID and connect an existing bank account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasÂ <a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-bitcoin-other-virtual-currency#.U3GCQ61dVD4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warned</a>Â potential investors that both fraudsters and promoters of high-risk investment schemes may target Bitcoin users.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Mining<a id="mining" name="mining"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img title="Laws have rarely been enforced to crackdown on Bitcoin miners." src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/84c26d3ce5a08fc25bb80819758c922c.jpg" alt="Laws have rarely been enforced to crackdown on Bitcoin miners." /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The FinCEN guidance states that users creating units of Bitcoins and exchanging them for flat currency can be considered money transmitters and might be subject to special laws and regulations that cover that type of activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, to this day the laws have rarely, if ever, been enforced to crackdown on Bitcoin miners.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Accepting payments in Bitcoins (for business)<a id="accepting-payments-in-bitcoins-for-business" name="accepting-payments-in-bitcoins-for-business"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img title="Business is required to pay taxes on income received through Bitcoin." src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/6e0e0d257452173415aeca3dcab8611a.jpg" alt="Business is required to pay taxes on income received through Bitcoin." /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Itâ€™s legal for businesses both big and small to accept Bitcoins payments. Assuming, of course, that itâ€™s a well-natured business that sells goods and services for regular currency and chooses to accept Bitcoin as another legal way to pay. Any business accepting Bitcoin payments is also required to pay taxes on income received through Bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has been recognized as a convertible virtual currency, which implies that accepting it as a form of payments is exactly the same as accepting cash, gold or gift cards.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Taxation<a id="taxation" name="taxation"></a></h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to a Virtual Currency Guidance, which was firstÂ <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">released</a>Â by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2014, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are to be treated as property instead of as currency and to be taxed as such. However, it isnâ€™t as simple as it might sound.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For instance, if you buy something worth $300 with your Bitcoins, it means that you just sold an asset. You either made a profit or a loss on that sale, depending on the Bitcoinâ€™s value when you bought it and when you sold it. Whether it counts as an ordinary or a capital gain, short or long term depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The regulation is not entirely clear, but the IRS is trying to crack down on reporting. In the year 2015, onlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/only-802-people-paid-taxes-on-bitcoin-profits-irs-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">802 people paid taxes</a>Â on Bitcoin profits. The IRS is apparentlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-uses-chainalysis-to-track-down-bitcoin-tax-cheats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using special software</a>Â to track down Bitcoin tax cheats.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A bipartisan bill, which calls for a tax exemption for transactions under $600, was recentlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-congressman-polis-legislation-abolishes-tax-for-us-crypto-payments-below-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a>Â in the House of Congress. If it passes, it will make lives of small, day-to-day traders much easier. Until then, it is recommended to keep records of all Bitcoin-related activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to trading Bitcoins, the records kept must contain the same information as stock or forex brokerage statements: date, description, quantity, price and fees. If youâ€™re mining, you might need to know when the Bitcoin proceeds were attained. Businesses accepting Bitcoins as a form of payment need to record reference of sales, the amount received in BTC and the date of the transaction. If sales taxes are payable, the amount due is calculated based on the average exchange rate at the time of sale.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">BitLicense<a id="bitlicense" name="bitlicense"></a></h2>
<p dir="ltr">BitLicense is a set of regulations regarding Bitcoin transactions put forward by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for Bitcoin companies operating in New York or serving NY residents. As of September 2017, two years after the regulation came into effect, onlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-ban-on-ico-is-temporary-licensing-to-be-introduced-official" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five licenses were granted</a>, and the companies that managed to obtain them had to spend upwards to $100,000 in order to do so. Many companies decided to opt-out of serving New York residents, with Bitfinex exchangeÂ <a href="https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/213919649-What-is-the-BitLicense-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">describing</a>Â the requirements set forth by NYDFS as â€˜extremely invasive,â€™ adding that they would compromise their user baseâ€™s privacy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The license can be obtained through a process of application, which costs $5,000. Companies looking to obtain the license will need to have a compliance officer, responsible for overseeing the firmâ€™s compliance with the regulations. Moreover, all other federal and state laws that apply to Bitcoin have to be obeyed. This includes compliance with Money Transmitter laws, Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies. Such protections can get very expensive.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Regulatorsâ€™ opinions<a id="regulators-opinions" name="regulators-opinions"></a></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">SEC â€” Securities and Exchange Commission<a id="sec--securities-and-exchange-commission" name="sec--securities-and-exchange-commission"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Securities and Exchange Commission has been notably quiet on the subject of Bitcoins, especially compared to regulatory bodies in other countries. In 2014, theyÂ <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/investoralertsia_bitcoin.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">published an investor alert</a>, in which they warned people that Bitcoin users can be targeted by fraudsters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SEC has recently investigated a cryptocurrency initial coin offering (ICO) called â€˜<a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/The_DAO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DAO</a>.â€™ which was hacked and about $50 mln worth of Ether coins were stolen. In this investigation, SEC focused primarily on whether DAO coins constituted a security. TheÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-is-still-eyeing-to-regulate-the-ico-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report concluded</a>Â that investing money in a token, expecting a profit which derives from the managerial efforts of other people makes a cryptocurrency a security and requires appropriate regulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, SECâ€™s report focused entirely on Initial Coin Offerings, and Bitcoin is way past that. So, any regulations SEC is likely to impose, will most likely only concern newcomers to the market. Whether Bitcoin can be treated as a security depends on the particular transaction, but SEC has decided that any firm using Blockchain technology to trade securities would need to register as an exchange, Alternative Trading System (ATS) or broker/dealer.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">FinCEN â€” Financial Crimes Enforcement Network<a id="fincen--financial-crimes-enforcement-network" name="fincen--financial-crimes-enforcement-network"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">According toÂ <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FinCENâ€™s guidance</a>Â on cryptocurrency, â€˜<a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Virtual_currency" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">virtual currency</a>,â€™ as they call it, is defined as a â€˜medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency.â€™ The guidance only addressed convertible virtual currency like Bitcoin, that can either act as a substitute for real currency or has an equivalent in existing currency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">â€˜Usersâ€™ of virtual currency are not considered an MSB (Money Serving Business) under FinCENâ€™s regulations. This means that if you obtained Bitcoins to pay for goods or services, you are not subject to MSB registration, reporting and recordkeeping regulations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In contrast, â€˜exchangersâ€™ and â€˜administratorsâ€™ are considered money transmitters, and therefore are required to comply with FinCENâ€™s regulations. The guidance defines â€˜exchangersâ€™ as people engaged as a business in the exchange of Bitcoins and other digital currencies, while â€˜administratorsâ€™ are engaged as a business in putting virtual currency into circulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In July 2017, in its first action against a foreign-located MSB operating in the U.S.,Â <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-fines-btc-e-virtual-currency-exchange-110-million-facilitating-ransomware" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FinCEN imposed</a>Â a Â£110 mln penalty on BTC-e exchange, arresting one of its operators and seizing the siteâ€™s domain.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">CFTC â€” Commodity Futures Trading Commission<a id="cftc--commodity-futures-trading-commission" name="cftc--commodity-futures-trading-commission"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">CFTC is an independent US Federal agency that looks after financial derivatives. In 2014, a CFTC Commissioner stated that the agency definitely has authority when it comes to Bitcoin, as they believed it can be classified as a commodity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recently, the agency released aÂ <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/file/labcftc_primercurrencies100417.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">primer</a>, in which they stated that virtual currencies can be considered commodities or derivatives contracts, depending on the particular facts and circumstances. This resulted in an eight percent drop in Bitcoinâ€™s exchange rate, as investors feared tighter regulations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CFTC seems to have taken a pro-Bitcoin stance, recentlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledgerx-completes-cftc-process-approved-for-bitcoin-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">granting</a>Â LedgerX the right to create a regulated Bitcoin futures market. In September 2017, CFTC filed its first-ever charges against Bitcoin fraudsters. In a move welcomed by genuine Bitcoin investors, Gelfman Blueprint was charged with fraud, misappropriation and issuing false account statements in connection with solicited investments in Bitcoin.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">IRS â€” Internal Revenue Service<a id="irs--internal-revenue-service" name="irs--internal-revenue-service"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Even though IRS released a generalÂ <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guidance</a>Â on taxing of digital currencies, many questions still remain unanswered. The agency further complicated things with its decision to tax Bitcoin as property, which means that even paying for a cup of coffee with the cryptocurrency will incur a tax.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the IRS regulations, buying goods and services with Bitcoin is exactly the same as selling an asset. If you spend your Bitcoins, it means that youâ€™ve either made a profit or a loss, depending on a BTCâ€™s exchange rate when you bought it and when you sold it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to comply with the IRS regulations, it is recommended that you keep a record of all your Bitcoin-related transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As only 0.04% of customers included crypto in their 2017 tax reports, the IRS has ramped up their hunt for Bitcoin tax evaders, having evenÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-forms-new-team-to-track-down-crypto-tax-evaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formed</a>Â a dedicated taskforce. However, while the IRS is closely monitoring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions in an attempt to get more tax dollars, there have beenÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-bitcoin-hunt-ramps-up-but-tax-amnesty-could-follow-expert-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumours</a>Â about a possible future tax amnesty for Bitcoin users. Whether it will actually happen as well as when it will happen still remains to be seen.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Federal Reserve<a id="federal-reserve" name="federal-reserve"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The US Federal Reserve is the worldâ€™s most influential banking entity, as it controls the global reserve currency - the US dollar. They are very interested in digital currencies and the technology associated with them, having published thorough papers on bothÂ <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2014/files/2014104pap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bitcoin</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016095pap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Blockchain</a>. The fact that a financial giant like Federal Reserve invested man-hours into understanding the concept of Bitcoin speaks volumes about how influential the currency is becoming.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the organization has repeatedly issued warnings about the risks associated with digital currencies. Recently, the Federal ReserveÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-federal-reserve-explores-the-potential-of-blockchain-lacks-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>Â that they are keeping very â€˜close attentionâ€™ to Blockchain, describing it as something that â€˜could ameliorate or exacerbate traditional financial risks.â€™ A US Fed Governor was alsoÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-fed-governor-digital-currency-could-make-it-easier-to-hide-illegal-activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quoted</a>Â saying that digital currencies could make it easier to hide illegal activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Janet Yellen, the US Federal Reserve chair, was recentlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-fed-chair-speaks-out-on-bitcoin-and-national-crypto">quoted</a>Â saying that the Fed is currently researching into introducing its own digital currency. If that happens, the U.S. will join the crypto market with their own, official and state-controlled cryptocurrency.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">FINRA â€” Financial Industry Regulatory Authority<a id="finra--financial-industry-regulatory-authority" name="finra--financial-industry-regulatory-authority"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The self-regulatory organization for U.S. brokers has been quite active in terms ofÂ <a href="http://www.finra.org/investors/highlights/what-you-should-know-about-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">defining</a>Â Bitcoin,Â <a href="http://www.finra.org/investors/bitcoin-basics-9-things-you-should-know-about-digital-currency" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">completing guides</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://www.finra.org/newsroom/2014/finra-issues-new-investor-alert-bitcoin-more-bit-risky" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">issuing warnings</a>Â for its clients.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is interesting, is that in itsÂ <a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/FINRA_Blockchain_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>Â on Distributed Ledger Technology FINRA implied that the widespread use of Blockchain technology could impact the organizationâ€™s core business practices. Specifically, the way FINRA members self-regulate in the areas of Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies, asset verification, business continuity, surveillance, payments and even record-keeping.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">OCC â€” Office of the Controller of the Currency<a id="occ--office-of-the-controller-of-the-currency" name="occ--office-of-the-controller-of-the-currency"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">In its 2016Â <a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/responsible-innovation/comments/special-purpose-national-bank-charters-for-fintech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">paper</a>, the office of the US Treasury proposed a possibility of moving forward with considering applications from fintech companies to become special purpose national banks (SPNBs). This initiative is set to provide companies that wish to become limited purpose digital banks with a unified federal regulatory regime. However, as of November 2017, there are still some significantÂ <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=de906e54-8736-4ba7-b2c9-87822eef1e51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">political and legal</a>Â uncertainties surrounding this initiative.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, the OCC released another optimisticÂ <a href="https://www.occ.gov/publications/publications-by-type/other-publications-reports/pub-responsible-innovation-banking-system-occ-perspective.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">paper</a>Â in which it called for the formation of a â€˜responsible innovationâ€™ department. They areÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-to-weaken-regulations-for-digital-currencies-blockchain-by-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a>Â to launch offices in Washington, New York and San Francisco to spur the growth of emerging technologies, including digital currencies.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">CFPB â€” Customer Financial Protection Bureau<a id="cfpb--customer-financial-protection-bureau" name="cfpb--customer-financial-protection-bureau"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Bureau hasÂ <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-warns-consumers-about-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">issued</a>Â a consumer warning about Bitcoin. The volatile exchange rates, possible lack of assistance from exchanges in case of lost funds and the threat of hacking and scams were cited among potential issues. Besides that, the CFPB has alsoÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/Federal-Consumer-Watchdog-Acknowledges-Bitcoin-s-Benefits-and-Wild%20West-Risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledged</a>Â Bitcoinâ€™s benefits.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Organizations which develop legislation<a id="organizations-which-develop-legislation" name="organizations-which-develop-legislation"></a></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly to most other governmental organizations, the US Senate and The House of Representatives havenâ€™t been very local in regard to Bitcoin and other digital currencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In August 2013, the US Senate sent out letters to various law enforcement agencies, asking about potential risks and threats in relation to cryptocurrencies. Most of the agenciesÂ <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/federal-agency-responses-us-government-attitudes-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a>Â with a cautious acknowledgment of legitimate uses of Bitcoins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since then, the topic of cryptocurrencies was often discussed both in Senate and The House of Representatives. In 2016, The Congressional Blockchain Caucus wasÂ <a href="https://qz.com/791360/bitcoin-caucus-the-us-congress-now-has-a-caucus-dedicated-to-bitcoin-and-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">formed</a>Â in order to bring all congressmen up to speed on a subject of Bitcoin and Blockchain in hopes of creating future laws that will affect that particular sector.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the Summer of 2017, US lawmakersÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmakers-draft-bill-protecting-cryptocurrencies-from-gov-interference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drafted</a>Â a bill that is set to protect cryptocurrencies from government interference. If the bill goes through it will provide protection to certain cryptocurrencies that comply with specific minimum requirements to prevent them from being used in illegal business practices. The bill is expected to be filed in the Fall of 2017.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Countries in which Bitcoin is banned<a id="countries-in-which-bitcoin-is-banned" name="countries-in-which-bitcoin-is-banned"></a></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">Bolivia<a id="bolivia" name="bolivia"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">In 2014, El Banco Central de Bolivia outrightÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrencies-banned-by-bolivia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned</a>Â any currency that wasnâ€™t issued by or regulated by the government. The bank specifically mentioned Bitcoins as well as some other digital currencies, but the ban extends to all cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bolivian authorities have recentlyÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bolivia-calls-cryptocurrency-pyramid-scheme-arrests-advocates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cracked down</a>Â on cryptocurrency use, labeling it a pyramid scheme and arresting 60 people. An accompanying statement emphasized that the action was necessary to remind the population that any kind of digital currency is prohibited.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Ecuador<a id="ecuador" name="ecuador"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Ecuadorian government has banned Bitcoin and all other digital currencies, due to the establishment of a new state-run electronic money system. The project is designed to be directly tied to the local currency and is controlled by the government.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Vietnam<a id="vietnam" name="vietnam"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">In 2014, Vietnamese Central BankÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/vietnam_forbids_bitcoin_transactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a statement</a>Â in which it explicitly prohibited the population to use Bitcoins within the country. This was done as a precautionary measure with the faith of digital currency set to be decided later by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According toÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/vietnamese-pm-approves-plan-to-authorize-bitcoin-as-form-of-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, in August of 2017, Vietnamese Prime Minister has authorized a plan that could potentially lead to the official recognition of Bitcoin and other digital currencies as a form of payment by 2018.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, in October 2017 Vietnamese government made another complete turnaround and outrightÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/vietnamese-central-bank-bans-cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned</a>Â the use of digital currency in the country. It was also announced that starting early 2018 anyone caught using digital currencies will face a fine.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Countries in which Bitcoin is legal<a id="countries-in-which-bitcoin-is-legal" name="countries-in-which-bitcoin-is-legal"></a></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">Australia<a id="australia" name="australia"></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Initially, Australians were potentially subject to goods-and-services tax when they either purchased or spent a cryptocurrency.

<p dir="ltr">The Finnish Tax AdministrationÂ <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/bitcoin-survey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decided</a>Â to treat Bitcoin transactions as private contracts equivalent to contracts for difference for tax purposes.

The regulations required Bitcoin distributors to limit the level of anonymity by identifying and verifying their users.

According to this policy, every time a Bitcoin is sold, the seller has to pay a capital gains tax of 25 percent.

This means that it will be taxed by the capital gains tax, which in Israel stands at 25% for private investors, while a marginal rate for businesses stands at 47%.
