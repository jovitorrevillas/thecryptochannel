All proceeds of the shop go to WikiLeaks operations, and customers can pay in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Neo, Namecoin, Vertcoin, Monero and ZCash through Coinpayments.net.

Last fall, WikiLeaks leaderÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/julian-assange">Julian Assange</a>Â <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/julian-assange-thanks-us-government-senators-for-forced-bitcoin-investment">publicly thanked</a>Â the US government on Twitter for forcing the organization to rely on Bitcoin due to the banking embargo, giving WikiLeaks a 50,000 percent return. Assange alsoÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/julian-assange-urges-donors-to-use-cryptocurrencies-thwart-government">urged WikiLeaks donors</a>Â to use cryptocurrencies for their donations as a way to avoid this financial blockade.
