<p dir="ltr">The Hanoi Department of Industry and Trade has banned organizations and individuals involved in e-commerce businesses in the city from using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to settle transactions online, in aÂ <a href="http://hanoi.gov.vn/tintuc_sukien/-/hn/ZVOm7e3VDMRM/7320/2812297/khong-su-dung-bitcoin-va-cac-loai-tien-ao-trong-thanh-toan-giao-dich-thuong-mai-ien-tu.html;jsessionid=dVOciJxqwkNv0gKLjPngKNGZ.app2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">document</a>Â issued to relevant parties on April 13.</p>
The document cites government decrees on non-cash payment instruments, emphasizing that â€œthe issuance, supply, use of Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies is prohibited in Vietnam.â€ Violations are subject to a â€œfine of between VND 150 mln ($6,608) and 200 mln ($8,810) for individuals and organizations.â€ Furthermore, as of January 2018, issuing and using cryptocurrencies â€œmay be subject to criminal prosecution.â€

Crypto-regulatory action in Vietnam intensifiedÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/vietnam-toughens-measures-on-crypto-amid-suspicion-of-biggest-scam-in-industry-history">last week</a>Â after Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc urged government and financial bodies to tighten their oversight of cryptocurrency-related activities.

The directive followed reports of what could be theÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/48-percent-returns-monthly-how-32000-vietnam-investors-got-caught-by-ponzi-scheme">largest crypto fraud in history</a>Â ($658 mln) if proven true, involving the alleged defrauding of 32,000 investors byÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/vietnam-pincoin-ifan-icos-exposed-as-scams-that-allegedly-stole-660-million">two ICOs</a>Â headed by a Vietnam-based outfit. Police are currently investigating the case.

AnÂ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/vietnam-bans-bitcoin-payments-global-markets-unfazed">outright ban</a>Â on using crypto as a means of payment has been in place in Vietnam since 2017, but the Ministry of Justice is now looking to flesh out a more robust and extensive regulatory framework following the Prime Ministerâ€™s orders.
