A project co-founded by experienced entrepreneurs within both the sports and the blockchain industries, Globatalent has vowed to revolutionize the sports industry by allowing young athletes the opportunity to fulfil their potential while at the same time giving sports back to its fans.

Globatalent‚Äôs CEO, Sunil Bhardwaj, who has accumulated experience within the sports of basketball, F1 and football/soccer, announced¬†<em>‚Äò‚ÄòGlobatalent is the platform that will radicalize sports through blockchain and cryptocurrency and we are absolutely delighted with the way the project is being received‚Äô‚Äô.</em>

<em>‚Äò‚ÄòWe have a really strong team with an extraordinary passion for decentralizing sports and transferring value directly to athletes and clubs and we‚Äôd love your support and interest to the project so we can share our confidence and knowledge and get you as excited about the project as we are‚Äô‚Äô</em>¬†added Sunil.

Globatalent has attracted the interest of top sporting athletes and investors include top ACB Basketball coach Richard Casas Gurt, former LA Lakers star Maurice Evans and Portuguese Tennis player Jo√£o Sousa who have decided to join in on a project that includes Ferran Martinez, a former professional FC Barcelona basketball player and Olympian.
<p dir="ltr">For the Token Generation Event, Globatalent will issue a single token identified with the ticker¬†<strong>‚ÄúGBT‚Äù</strong>. Since GBT may qualify as a security token based on its intended function, only accredited investors may access Globatalent‚Äôs ICO.</p>
The initial launch of the platform will be through a crowd sale dashboard accessible via¬†<a href="http://www.globatalent.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">www.globatalent.com</a>¬†offering 500,000,000 of the 1,000,000,000 initial GBT tokens. The GBT tokens will be distributed in two crowd sales; an initial private pre-sale followed by a public sale.

Instructions to participate in the sale will be provided on Globatalent‚Äôs social media channels and via email. The Token Sale event will take place over a secured platform that specialises in validation of participants through country-specific KYC/AML procedures.

The Private Pre-Sale will commence on Thursday 15th March 2018 with the Public Sale opening on Friday 16th April 2018. The ICO finishes on Sunday 6th May 2018.
