Worldcore, an EU-regulated payment platform, has announced the launch of large update packages after a successful fundraising campaign. The most important update announced is a wallet for Ethereum tokens. Since it is a network of computers, rather than one central point, all applications are better protected against hacking attacks and fraudulent activities.

The currency on the Ethereum platforms is the Ether (ETH). However, within DAPPS (decentralized applications), which are built by users, often an Ethereum token is used as payment to make the process more simple. Each DAPP a different token is however not a smart idea, as a code would have to be updated each time you‚Äôd want to operate within a new DAPP.

Therefore, in 2015, the Initial Standard Tokens were introduced. Later, ¬†the Ethereum Request for Comments 20, a.k.a. ERC20 standard for tokens, was added. New tokens must be ERC20 compliant, so they can interact with various wallets.

This token storage provides the highest level of security of all wallets currently on the market. With its charts and future analytic tools, smart price alerts via e-mail, SMS and Telegram bot and other solutions for professional traders, there is nothing like it out there now. The company, that has been operating since 2014, has a team of professionals working on the development of all the tools.

Another announced update is the integration of the cryptocurrency support into Woldcore mobile apps for iOS and Android Platforms. The Woldcore mobile development team has been working on this subject recently. Both of these updates were made possible by the fundraising campaign. Even before the end of the campaign, however, Woldcore launched a prototype of Worldcore.trade. Worldcore has now announced that the team is planning to launch the final version in April of this year.

The company is also working on Roadmap execution. To be able to provide an higher level of service, Worldcore has joined both SWIFT and SEPA networks. Moreover, a new collaboration with Safe Charge will likely result in over 30 new payment methods for account top-up and pay outs before the mid of April of this year.

With these new updates, Worldcore has strengthened its position on the market. As the first and only payment platform supporting cutting edge biometrics authentication options via face and voice recognition technologies, the company has already proven to be a big player in the industry. Worldcore is a member of prestigious Emerging Payments Association, Euro Banking Association and Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and a regular participant of the largest fintech events of Europe, including Finovate Europe and Money2020. Worldcore is also a proud sponsor of the International Red Cross foundation.

The Woldcore‚Äôs token, WRC, is currently listed on OKex, HitBtc, Coinexchange and YoBit exchange. To create a better coverage of the market, Worldcore is currently working on listing it on other major exchanges as well. The first upcoming exchange where WRC will be listed is KuCoin.
