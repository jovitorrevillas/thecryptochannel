<p dir="ltr">With 1 billion tokens up for grabs, players and investors can snap up 75% of the company, with Cryptonia keeping 20% back to fund promotions and tournaments, with only 5% of the total paid out to promoters and advisers to get the room up and running.</p>

<div>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, one of the biggest selling points of crypto-poker rooms over their rivals is the security aspect ‚Äì and the blockchain technology which Cryptonia‚Äôs platform is based on ensures fair play and also helps to avoid delays in payment processing, offering absolute transparency and ease of play.</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
<div class="post-full-text contents js-post-full-text">
<div>
<h2>So, what can players expect from Cyptonia?</h2>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">The first part of the plan is to get the tournament schedule up-and-running, with attractive guarantees designed to pull in new players and boost the pool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This in turn will see the price of Cryptonia rise so, as with most ICO‚Äôs, it‚Äôs the early birds who make the most out of it.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Rakeback scheme</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptonia‚Äôs plan to return 35% of the rake every month will see them add it to jackpots, bounties and tournament guarantees, the combination designed to motivate people to play more and also to add liquidity to the poker rooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the Cryptonia community grows, so too will the number and variants of games on offer, with a 24/7 schedule to ‚Äòentertain gamers from different parts of the world‚Äô and of all different levels.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Huge Market Value</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptonia are looking to cut themselves a chunk of an online gambling market which is expected to hit $59.79 billion dollars by the year 2020 and their eponymous currency ‚ÄòCryptonias‚Äô will help those who invest and/or win at the tables ‚Äì the value expected to grow as the room gets bigger and players start winning and spending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With their Ethereum-based currency listed on exchanges, users getting value additions on the currency they hold, players can also add or withdraw funds easily and quickly wherever they live. Cryptonia Poker explain that ‚Äòthe Ethereum-based contracts comply with ERC20‚Äô so transactions can be carried out ‚Äòwith ease of mind‚Äô.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Anti-bot, pro-amateur</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptonia Poker are well aware of the modern-day trend for sites to be infested with poker-playing robots ‚Äì or bots as they are known ‚Äì and are ahead of the game when it comes to rooting them out, ‚Äòmeasures being taken and programs being integrated in the platform to ensure that only recreational players will benefit‚Äô according to the developers behind the new crypto-poker room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Add to this fantastic security and development plans going forward and Cryptonia Poker can expect to grab more than their fair of players from different countries around the world.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">When does Cryptonia Poker‚Äôs ICO kick off?</h2>

Singpapore based Technology Company; XinFin today announced the joining of Bitcoin.com CEO, Roger Ver to its Advisory Board, effective immediately. Furthermore, Ver‚Äôs colleague and Bitcoin.com COO Mate Tokay has been welcomed to advisory team of XinFin as well. Ver and Tokay are distinguished names and are considered to be leading influencers within the crypto world and will bring big-time insights and experience to XinFin.io

XinFin‚Äôs vision aligns with Roger‚Äôs philosophy and ideology. Due to the fact that XinFin‚Äôs ecosystem will open up to the Global Trade and Finance for USD 27 Trillion market, it will offer everyone the potential for a swift and wealthier individual lifestyle, which supports the idea of libertarianism that is embraced by Roger.

Since Roger supports Bitcoin Cash and Mate supports Bitcoin, XinFin decided to add BCH and BTC to their list of accepted currencies for their ongoing¬†<a href="http://www.xinfin.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">Token Sale</a>¬†to trim the impediments for their potential traders and future investors to become a part of XinFin ecosystem.

Ecosystem Development Head and Director of XinFin Fintech, Atul Khekade and Peter Yeo seemed quite elated with the latest development and stated:
<blockquote>‚ÄúWe are very excited about Roger and Mate joining our Token sale. Roger and Mate enjoy an influential track record in the cryptocurrency industry and have already left their significant footprints in the community. Their powerful engagement coincides with our earnest objection to build and deploy blockchain solutions across global trade and finance and reduce inefficiencies in global commerce with our XDCE Token. Having top-notch personalities from the crypto world, combined with our rapidly growing business powered by our exchange-listed company, makes us all the more confident to set the right path for an integral token growth.‚Äù</blockquote>
<h2>Roger Ver</h2>
Take a look at any¬†Who‚Äôs Who in Bitcoin¬†list and you‚Äôll find Roger Ver near the top of that list. Dubbed ‚ÄòBitcoin Jesus‚Äô, Ver is a pioneer for Bitcoin adoption around the world. In 2011, Ver‚Äôs company, MemoryDealers.com, became the first mainstream company to accept Bitcoin as a payment option. He is considered to be the first Bitcoin angel investor, having funded the seed rounds for most of the entire first generation of Bitcoin-related organisations and businesses, including:
<ul>
 	<li>The Bitcoin Foundation</li>
 	<li>Bitpay</li>
 	<li>Blockchain.info</li>
 	<li>Ripple</li>
 	<li>Kraken</li>
 	<li>Bitcoin.com</li>
</ul>
Ver is a proponent of libertarianism and voluntaryism, believing in an individual‚Äôs right to freedom of choice, voluntary association, and self-governance. These beliefs are in harmony with XinFin‚Äôs mission, which is to deploy blockchain solutions across global trade and finance and reduce inefficiencies in global commerce. XinFin‚Äôs hybrid blockchain platform called TradeFinex will offer both tokenized and non-tokenized solutions to promote business process efficiency improvement, thereby helping people undertake projects without burdening govt. treasury and organizations secure and cost-effective business solutions that boost their profitability.

Speaking about XinFin, Ver stated:¬†<strong><em>‚ÄúI am thrilled to be joining a team who, like me, is also focused on everyone‚Äôs right to freedom of choice in global trade and finance, enhancing participant and user outcomes through cryptographic money.‚Äù</em></strong>
<h2>Mate Tokay</h2>
‚ÄòBitcoin Disciple‚Äô to Ver‚Äôs ‚ÄòBitcoin Jesus‚Äô, Mate Tokay is without question one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most active and vocal proponents. A professional athlete and former wakeboard world champion, Tokay made his first foray into the crypto space when he began mining Bitcoin in 2013 using custom-built ASIC miners. Since then he has gone on to spread the word about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at conferences and speaking engagements around the world.

In keeping with his desire to educate people about Bitcoin, Tokay founded the crypto media news website¬†Bitcoinist¬†in 2013. Since then, he has continued to keep his finger on the pulse of the cryptocurrency industry and has been involved in several successful blockchain-related projects.

Tokay‚Äôs role within the Bitcoin community has been described as ‚Äú[focusing] on a larger vision and communicating that vision to others while staying on top of trends in the industry. His goal and passion is to make cryptocurrencies as popular as possible.‚Äù

Mate Tokay claimed:<em>¬†‚ÄúI am excited to join the XinFin team in my advisory role strategically as well as operationally. My goal will be to provide complete transparency, fungibility and ease of use and through XinFin and its ecosystem of services; it is on the right path.‚Äù</em>
<h2>XDCE Token Sale</h2>
In the wake of Roger Ver‚Äôs and Mate Tokay‚Äôs appointment to XinFin‚Äôs Advisory Board, XinFin.io has decided to add Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC) to the list of accepted currencies for its ongoing token sale.

XinFin-Ecosystem Development Head Atul Khekade explained:
<blockquote>‚ÄúWhile Bitcoin is world‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency, BCH also puts on as the future of crypto world‚Äîall thanks to its small transactional costs and other prominent benefits. Hence, we trust that these additions will help trim the impediments for our potential traders and future investors to become a part of XinFin ecosystem.‚Äù</blockquote>
XinFin launched its utility token XDCE on Feb 5, 2018. XDCE is an ERC20 token which will have multifold benefits for traders, private investors and institutional level partners. The exchange rate for XDCE is 1 XDCE= $0.006. Investors can buy tokens using ETH, BCH, BTC, XRP. Long term investors and institutions who wish to use FIAT currency, can also participate through bank transfers.
<ul>
 	<li>Token Name: XDCE</li>
 	<li>Ticker Symbol: XDCE</li>
 	<li>Token Price: 1 ETH=133,000 XDCE</li>
 	<li>Max Cap in Tokens: 15 Billion XDCE</li>
 	<li>Tokens Available for Sale: 6 Billion XDCE</li>
 	<li>Minimum Purchase: 0.1 ETH</li>
 	<li>Maximum Purchase: 2500 ETH</li>
 	<li>Accepted Currencies: ETH, BCH, BTC, XRP</li>
 	<li>Start Date: February 5, 2018 (00.00 EST)</li>
 	<li>End Date: March 15, 2018 (11.59 EST)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.xinfin.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">Token Sale Page</a></li>
</ul>
<em>‚ÄúThe XDCE token will predominantly help traders who compete against other ERC20 tokens across various exchanges. XDCE token is swappable which means it can be swapped 1:1 with the standard XDC token without any transaction fee. While our reach becomes more versatile in the open crypto market with this launch, traders will also leverage from XDCE‚Äôs compatibility and tradability on most exchanges. Traders can perform quick, high volume trades using XDCE token, allowing institutional level partners to primarily use the XDC01(XDC) token. This will enable XDC01 to grow strictly from use cases whereas traders using XDCE can connect and benefit from growth of standard XDC token.‚Äù</em>¬†‚Äì XinFin Fintech.

A project co-founded by experienced entrepreneurs within both the sports and the blockchain industries, Globatalent has vowed to revolutionize the sports industry by allowing young athletes the opportunity to fulfil their potential while at the same time giving sports back to its fans.

Globatalent‚Äôs CEO, Sunil Bhardwaj, who has accumulated experience within the sports of basketball, F1 and football/soccer, announced¬†<em>‚Äò‚ÄòGlobatalent is the platform that will radicalize sports through blockchain and cryptocurrency and we are absolutely delighted with the way the project is being received‚Äô‚Äô.</em>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Limassol, Cyprus (March 8, 2018)</strong>¬†‚Äî Circle.One is a blockchain-based marketplace for data, analytics and research. Become a Circle decision maker and reserve your CLC tokens now. ICO starting in Q2/18.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The scientific and research market is crying for disruption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Important research remains unpublished while the quality of mainstream scientific journals is rapidly sinking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Researchers lack relevant data, while the number of possible data sources is exploding at the same time, thanks to IoT sensors and the increased digitalization. Most of this data never gets used and is locked up in company data centers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Circle.One will offer world class data, analytics and research that are:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
 	<li>easy to find</li>
 	<li>rated by users just like you</li>
 	<li>instantly available</li>
 	<li>with a fee-less payment system</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">CIRCLE.ONE¬†‚Äì make informed decisions! Make more money!</p>
<p dir="ltr">A working, blockchain-powered proof of concept was already developed by the experienced in-house developers. CIRCLE.ONE is going full blast to bring this project to fruition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‚ÄòBig Industry players like financial services, medical research, pharmaceutical, manufacturing or consumer statistics are based on data and research. These industries have great purchasing power and are able to spend tens of thousands of dollars on information, when it is essential for their business and decision-making process. Circle.One delivers this kind of information and provides the data and research needed. The ease of use and scope offered make us the Amazon of data, analytics and research,‚Äô said Walter Komarek, CEO and co-founder of Circle.One.</p>

<h2>Join our ICO</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Starting on 8th of March, Circle.One will accept selected investors for its private pre-sale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Circle.One‚Äôs token is called CLC. CLC is a QRC20 token on the Qtum blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our public ICO will start in Q2/18.</p>

<h2>Main ICO details</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There will never be more than 500.000.000 CLCs .</p>
<p dir="ltr">Limited bonuses are negotiated on a one to one basis during the private pre-sale phase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CLC token will be used to pay for all aspects of CIRCLE.ONE‚Äôs ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token‚Äôs value will appreciate substantially, as demand for the network grows. And more and better quality is on offer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CLC tokens are the only currency accepted on CIRCLE.ONE. So trade volume and demand should remain high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Expect monthly news from CIRCLE.ONE‚Äôs team about the development, which will have a positive impact on exchange prices.</p>

There are many Initial Coin Offerings on the market today, but I have something to tell you. Talenthon, a UK Recruitment Platform, is one of the best ICO projects for 2018 and is undoubtedly the ultimate ICO to invest in this year.

In a nutshell, Talenthon has designed and built a state of the art ecosystem that technically evaluates candidate‚Äôs skills, validates their CVs and checks their references (an employer‚Äôs dream) all powered by cryptocurrency, their talent coin, using Blockchain and Gamification Technology.

Verifying CVs is very hard for employers and without putting in extensive efforts and money to evaluate and assess every candidate that an employer wants to employ can become very problematic. Especially in an industry where fake CVs and profiles cannot be regularly policed on traditional job boards, like indeed, and social media platforms, like LinkedIn.

Giving employers a reliable, accurate and a trustworthy blockchain based record of a potential candidate‚Äôs education, skill performance, training and even work-related references could change the recruitment industry for the better. Using Talenthon‚Äôs platform could potentially reduce the burden on data-heavy processes, like administration and onboarding, and it would even enhance fraud prevention as well as reducing the clutter from fake CVs. These are naming just a few of the benefits that a blockchain based record can produce for the recruitment industry.

Without a question of doubt, talent finding and management could be obtained from both sides of Talenthon‚Äôs service relationship. For example, candidates would be able to manage the blockchain based record of their education, skill performance, references, and training, while employers would be able to gain access to potential data of people who match their criteria to fulfil their job role. This would potentially aid employers‚Äô, and recruitment agencies alike, with the proficiency to hire talented candidates. Employers would be able to use Talenthon‚Äôs data to match individuals to roles much more precisely and efficiently.

Talenthon‚Äôs vision to infuse blockchain technology into their platform would undoubtedly shake up how employers hire their work-force. It would also transform how people would perceive the skills needed to secure a job role, and it would add value for them knowing that they have a fully-fledged CV profile that cannot be altered in any way.

CEDEX promises to bridge the gap between the traditional diamond industry and innovative financial markets. For the first time, general investors could have the opportunity to confidently invest in diamonds as they would in other traditional assets.

Historically, diamonds have resembled gold and other precious metals as a steady store of value. That said, there are a few significant issues that continue to prevent diamonds from being an option for the average investor. Until recently, there weren‚Äôt any practical solutions to those issues, and it seemed that the massive potential of the diamond market would remain mostly untapped.

Now, that‚Äôs finally set to change. With the advent of cryptocurrencies and their recent surge in popularity, innovation is spreading to all kinds of other applications. CEDEX is one of those innovative projects - a blockchain-based diamond exchange with a novel approach to the diamond financial market.

First, it‚Äôs important to understand the issues that the diamond industry currently faces. Those are a lack of transparency, lack of liquidity, and lack of standardization.

The diamond business has a prevalent ‚Äúclosed shop mentality‚Äù that makes it just about impossible for anyone who‚Äôs not ‚Äúin the know‚Äù to understand how a diamond is valued and to gauge its true worth. This results in a lack of clear and transparent pricing, hindering the ability of general investors to purchase diamonds with confidence.

There‚Äôs also a lack of liquidity that plagues sellers who try to get a fair market value for their stones. The problem is that diamonds are mainly sold to end consumers in a one-sided transaction. This skewed market automatically places anyone who owns a diamond at a severe disadvantage if they want to resell it. So much so, in fact, that most resales incur a loss of 30% - 50% of the market price.

And finally, it‚Äôs important to note that diamond pricing has a complete lack of standardization stemming from the fact that diamonds aren‚Äôt fungible. Each diamond is unique, and its value can‚Äôt be determined from any one metric on its own. As a result, the average person who just wants to determine a diamond‚Äôs value needs to take it to a professional appraiser. The appraiser then subjectively assesses the value based on the 4Cs of diamond quality: color grade, clarity grade, cut grade, and carat weight.

Those are the three problems that have been holding the diamond market back for years. CEDEX addresses all three with an innovation and multi-faceted solution.

Part 1 of the solution is CEDEX.com - the exchange platform that brings together the two sides of the diamond market without a middleman. CEDEX uses Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain technology and smart contracts to trustlessly enforce the terms of transactions between diamond buyers and sellers. On the supply side of the market, the exchange platform serves as a new distribution channel for existing diamond dealers, as well as a way for private diamond holders to resell their diamonds at fairer prices than they could hope to get today. On the demand side, CEDEX has appeal to general investors who could buy diamonds as a hedge against inflation and the stock market, as well as cryptocurrency investors who could invest in a less volatile crypto asset.

The second, completely novel part of the solution is the DEX. If diamonds are going to be as easy to invest in and trade as other traditional assets, there needs to be a way for anybody to efficiently and accurately appraise a diamond‚Äôs value. That‚Äôs the role played by the DEX. It‚Äôs a machine learning algorithm that was created as a means of transparently and coherently evaluating diamonds, with a pricing accuracy rate of over 99.5%.

The DEX appraises three main elements of each diamond. First, it analyzes data collected directly from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in order to assign diamonds with a gemological ‚Äúscore‚Äù, representing its gemological purity. Then it assesses the parallel composite, which indicates how rare the particular type of diamond is. Finally, it accounts for the diamond indices composite, using globally published indexes to provide investors with insights on the market‚Äôs direction.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, transparency and trustlessness are absolutely critical. CEDEX establishes new standards for those factors in the diamond market, showing the benefits that are possible for tokenization of additional real-world assets like stock, real estate, and other commodities.
<h2>CEDEX Coin Token Pre-Sale</h2>
Investors who participate in the upcoming token pre-sale will capitalize on the best opportunity to get CEDEX Coins at a low price before the decentralized exchange goes live in Q3 and transforms the diamond market. Participants who buy the first 10% of available tokens will receive a 30% bonus. After that, buyers of the next 40% of available tokens will receive a 15% bonus.

The minimum contribution for the token pre-sale is 1 ETH. There will not be a minimum contribution for the subsequent general token sale.

The company GEO and the team behind it first attracted the attention of XYO Network during EthDenver, one of the largest hackathons for Ethereum in¬†the United States.

"We're excited about the addition of GEO to our crypto-location portfolio," said XYO Network co-founder¬†Markus Levin.
<blockquote>"GEO adds an additional feature set to XYO by trustlessly notifying a device that an object was there with absolute certainty, and without having to communicate private data with the network."</blockquote>
GEO was conceived and built by three highly talented students, one of whom is world renowned hacker¬†Jack Cable. Cable, a high school student, is best known for competing against 600 hackers from around the world in 2017 as part of Hack the Air Force, a partnership between the Department of Defense and HackerOne, a bug bounty platform.¬†Cable found 40 vulnerabilities on the Air Force site, which placed him first on the event leaderboard.

Owen Shen¬†and Zefram Lou, both freshmen enrolled at UC San Diego, rounded out the EthDenver GEO team. Both had already garnered their own fair share of attention in the blockchain space before joining XYO Network with Cable as an XYO Network adviser.

<a class="fancybox" title="XYO + GEO" href="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/7f2b6fd1cc282f9d372c759c778547d1.png" rel="gallery"><img title="XYO + GEO" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/7f2b6fd1cc282f9d372c759c778547d1.png" alt="XYO + GEO" /></a>
<h2>A closer look at how GEO works</h2>
GEO provides a protocol that allows anyone to easily distribute and verify Proofs of Location in a decentralized network, all without a massive overhead.

Companies often require a verifiable Proof of Location, but traditional metrics, like GPS, are easy to spoof. GEO approaches this challenge differently. It is centered around Nodes, which are devices set at a fixed physical location. Users can connect to the Nodes via Bluetooth and receive a Proof of Location signature. The signature is unique because it relies on the user's unique device ID as well as the time-stamp, cryptographically proving that the device was indeed near the Node at the time specified.
<h2>Designed for many possible uses</h2>
To accommodate a global market, GEO is multi-platform and utilizes Bluetooth so that it can be accessed on any enabled device.¬†The GEO mobile app is written universally in Ionic, meaning it can be deployed on any mobile operating system. Nodes are written in Javascript. The mobile app and the node communicate via Bluetooth, with the node returning the Proof of Location signature. To protect user privacy, the GEO team created a smart contract model for probabilistic Proofs of Location for a variety of possible uses including:
<ul type="disc">
 	<li><strong>eCommerce</strong>: Companies like Amazon and UPS an offer, as a premium service, an independently confirmed ledger to track every step of a shipment's progress, starting at the fulfillment center and ending with the package's secure delivery within the customer's home.</li>
 	<li><strong>Automated Drones</strong>: Automated drones operating independently of each other will be able to communicate their relative and absolute locations using a universal protocol.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hospitals</strong>: By tying the XYO Network into the operational frameworks that are already in place in Hospitals, care providers can significantly reduce failures in communication and record keeping that result in patient injury and death.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding to a growing XYO Network portfolio</h2>
The addition of GEO to XYO Network's portfolio continues a larger commitment to facilitating an open ecosystem of GEOspatial blockchain applications.

As a demonstration of this commitment, XYO Network recently funded¬†<a href="https://prysmaticlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener" data-include="300615575">Prysmatic Labs</a>, which also just received a¬†$100,000¬†grant from Ethereum creator¬†Vitalik Buterin¬†as part of the¬†<a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/03/07/announcing-beneficiaries-ethereum-foundation-grants/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener" data-include="300615575">inaugural Ethereum Foundation grant awards</a>.

Continuing with its mission of collaboration, XYO Network and GEO have provided access to several libraries where developers can host and review code, manage projects and build software to bring added value to GEO going forward.
<h2>A leader in crypto-location technology</h2>
As all forms of commerce become more reliant on location data, smart cities and companies of the future will increase their dependence on that data exponentially. However, one of the biggest challenges is finding a more efficient and foolproof way to deliver trustworthy location data. XYO Network has focused efforts on making trustless location data possible through an ecosystem of crypto-location technologies and protocols.

The introduction of Ethereum brought about "smart contracts" which are transaction protocols that collapse payment and execution of an agreement into the same thing. However, Ethereum's major drawback was that smart contracts need a centralized third-party for verification, making those contracts vulnerable to hackers.

To eliminate this vulnerability, XYO Network built the world's first decentralized location verification system with more than one million Bluetooth and GPS devices already around the world. After years of investment and breakthroughs in crypto-location technology, XYO is poised to help bring the promise and the benefits of blockchain technology to the real world on a massive and global scale in location-reliant trade markets that generate a staggering¬†$11 trillion¬†in activity.

<em>Senior VP for Business Development to leave solutions provider to establish new blockchain and gambling venture.</em>
<div><strong>London, UK ‚Äì 19 March 2018.</strong>¬†Tom Light, Senior Vice-President of Business Development at SBTech, is to leave the group to establish a new business venture that will unite blockchain and gambling and leverage the power of the crypto-currency in a gaming and betting environment.</div>
Tom Light joined SBTech in 2014 to lead its business development and commercial efforts and initiated the massive growth curve the group has experienced since.

He has been responsible for signing many of SBTech‚Äôs defining partnerships and will continue to retain the full support of the company in future projects.

Commenting on his next move, Tom Light said: ‚ÄúI have really enjoyed working at SBTech and seeing the group grow to become the leading sports betting and gaming solutions provider to the sector. The new project I will be heading is particularly exciting as it combines two great passions of mine: blockchain and gambling. It will leverage the power of crypto-currencies within an igaming setting and produce a truly disruptive offer for the sector.‚Äù

Richard Carter, CEO of SBTech, added: ‚ÄúSBTech is particularly grateful to Tom for his incredible work over the past four years, which has enabled us to experience massive growth and has put SBTech in prime position to capitalise on future opportunities in the online and land-based gaming and betting sector worldwide. He retains the full support of SBTech and we look forward to his new project, which we believe will be as successful as the past four years he has had with SBTech.‚Äù

Tom Light recently discussed the possibilities of blockchain within gambling at the iGaming Asia Congress in Macau in the company of Mikhail Bogdanov, CEO of Firelotto and Tony Tong, Crypto Angel Investor at DRC ‚Äì Drchain.io.

Worldcore, an EU-regulated payment platform, has announced the launch of large update packages after a successful fundraising campaign. The most important update announced is a wallet for Ethereum tokens. Since it is a network of computers, rather than one central point, all applications are better protected against hacking attacks and fraudulent activities.

The currency on the Ethereum platforms is the Ether (ETH). However, within DAPPS (decentralized applications), which are built by users, often an Ethereum token is used as payment to make the process more simple. Each DAPP a different token is however not a smart idea, as a code would have to be updated each time you‚Äôd want to operate within a new DAPP.

Therefore, in 2015, the Initial Standard Tokens were introduced. Later, ¬†the Ethereum Request for Comments 20, a.k.a. ERC20 standard for tokens, was added. New tokens must be ERC20 compliant, so they can interact with various wallets.

<a href="https://worldcore.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=ru&amp;q=https://worldcore.eu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1521528983257000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6LMoJ7xoqhGsNDbfmJ4qk-Elejg">Worldcore</a>¬†has now announced the world‚Äôs first EU-regulated PCI DSS compliant wallet for Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens. This token storage provides the highest level of security of all wallets currently on the market. With its charts and future analytic tools, smart price alerts via e-mail, SMS and Telegram bot and other solutions for professional traders, there is nothing like it out there now. The company, that has been operating since 2014, has a team of professionals working on the development of all the tools.

Another announced update is the integration of the cryptocurrency support into Woldcore mobile apps for iOS and Android Platforms. The Woldcore mobile development team has been working on this subject recently. Both of these updates were made possible by the fundraising campaign. Even before the end of the campaign, however, Woldcore launched a prototype of Worldcore.trade. Worldcore has now announced that the team is planning to launch the final version in April of this year.

The company is also working on Roadmap execution. To be able to provide an higher level of service, Worldcore has joined both SWIFT and SEPA networks. Moreover, a new collaboration with Safe Charge will likely result in over 30 new payment methods for account top-up and pay outs before the mid of April of this year.

With these new updates, Worldcore has strengthened its position on the market. As the first and only payment platform supporting cutting edge biometrics authentication options via face and voice recognition technologies, the company has already proven to be a big player in the industry. Worldcore is a member of prestigious Emerging Payments Association, Euro Banking Association and Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and a regular participant of the largest fintech events of Europe, including Finovate Europe and Money2020. Worldcore is also a proud sponsor of the International Red Cross foundation.

The Woldcore‚Äôs token, WRC, is currently listed on OKex, HitBtc, Coinexchange and YoBit exchange. To create a better coverage of the market, Worldcore is currently working on listing it on other major exchanges as well. The first upcoming exchange where WRC will be listed is KuCoin.
